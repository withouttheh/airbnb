Introduction:
This Jupyter Notebook explores a dataset containing information about Airbnb listings in Cape Town. The dataset comprises various attributes such as listing ID, host details, geographical coordinates, room type, pricing, availability, and review-related metrics. With over 22,000 entries and 18 columns, the dataset offers a comprehensive overview of the Airbnb market in Cape Town.

In this project, we aim to analyze and understand the dynamics of the Airbnb market in Cape Town. By leveraging the power of Python and the Pandas library, we will delve into the dataset to uncover insights, trends, and patterns that can provide valuable information for both hosts and guests alike.

Our analysis will cover a wide range of aspects, including pricing trends, popularity of room types, host behaviors, geographical distribution of listings, and more. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical techniques, we will gain deeper insights into the Airbnb ecosystem in the area.

Ultimately, this project seeks to offer actionable insights and recommendations for various stakeholders, including Airbnb hosts, prospective guests, and policymakers, to make informed decisions and enhance their experiences within the Airbnb community.
